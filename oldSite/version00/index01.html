  <p>Hi, this is Ling.</p>
  <p>I really love computer graphics, whether it is static or in motion, one image  or a sequence of images, I love them all.</p>
  <p>Here is my work and I labeled them as:<br />
    <a href="print.html">print</a>, <a href="web.html" class="style1">web</a>, <a href="3d.html">3D </a>and <a href="photo.html">photo</a>. </p>
  <h1><a href="print.html">Design for Press</a></h1>
  <p>I learned graphic design at Rosemount Technology Centre. </p>
  <p>One important thing I learned at RTC is,  that any typo, wrong color, or even bad trapping can ruin a project, and in printing that costs a lot of money. In printing  zero mistakes are tolerated.</p>
  <p>It's a big responsibility for everyone on the team.</p>
  <h1><a href="web.html">Design for Web</a></h1>
  <p>Most of  my web knowledge is self-taught. </p>
  <p>What I like about web design is that you get what you see. </p>
  <p>The chanllenge  is to keep up with many different standards in the web industry, making a  website suitable for different browsers, different operating systems, and different platformsâ€¦</p>
  <h1><a href="3d.html">3D</a></h1>
  <p>I enjoy doing animation using Maya. It is like being an actor in a movie, an actor that does't use my own body but a puppet in the computer. </p>
  <h1><a href="photo.html">Photography</a></h1>
  <p>I think taking photos is not only an excellent training for my design but also a lot of fun. I used several my photos in my design, and I like it. I can save a lot of money with my pocket-size camera. :)</p>
